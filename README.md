COVID19 AND ANTIVAX SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

Description:
- During the span of the Covid 19 Pandemic and with the introduction of the Covid 19 Vaccine to the general public, there has been a great political polarization seen in the United States of America, and a rise in an Anti-Vaccination sentiment. Due to this Anti-Vaccination movement, an increase in hesitancy and rejection towards vaccinations, especially for Covid 19, has also been observed. The aim for this analysis is to determine where the hesitancy/rejection corresponding with the Anti-Vaccination movement was the most prevalent, and whether or not type of sentiment was a threat to public health.
